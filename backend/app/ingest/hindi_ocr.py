"""Read a Hindi NCERT book by OCR, because its text layer cannot be trusted at all.

The real files (Kshitij, Kritika, Sparsh, Sanchayan) embed a pre-Unicode font --
Walkman-Chanakya -- with no ``ToUnicode`` CMap. Every glyph is drawn from a WinAnsi code
point chosen to *look like* Devanagari in that one font; nothing in the PDF says what
Unicode character it actually is. ``page.get_text()`` (what ``book.read_text`` uses for
every other subject) returns that raw code point back as if it were real text, which
decodes as mojibake regardless of which PyMuPDF call reads it -- this is not the layout
problem every other subject's fix addressed, it is a font-encoding problem no amount of
regex on the existing text layer can solve.

Reading the *rendered page image* sidesteps the encoding entirely: OCR reads the ink, not
the font's internal numbering, so it comes back as real Unicode Devanagari. Tried two
ways before settling on the CLI: PyMuPDF's own ``get_textpage_ocr()`` also shells out to
Tesseract, but its default page segmentation broke words apart mid-conjunct on these
files ("पाठ्यसामग्रीकापुनर्सयोजन" with no spaces at all) where invoking the ``tesseract``
binary directly on a rendered pixmap did not.
